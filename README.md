# Car Insurance Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involved a comprehensive analysis of car insurance data for a leading insurance company, focusing on calculating the loss ratio. The company operates in a highly competitive market and processes a vast amount of policy-related information daily. This project encompassed various facets of data integration, transformation, and analysis.

## Business Scenario

The primary aim was to evaluate the loss ratioâ€”a pivotal metric that measures the company's ability to manage risk and profitability. The data was provided in two Excel files, each containing valuable information about policies. By developing a function to determine policy elapsed days within a specified financial year, we were able to calculate premium per day and subsequently the loss ratio. This analytical effort not only streamlined the company's operations but also uncovered data irregularities, contributing to the enhancement of their data collection system.

## Approach

**Data Integration** : The primary task was to consolidate data from two separate Excel files, both containing critical information about insurance policies. These files included details such as policy numbers, coverage types, premium amounts, and claim records.

**Policy Elapsed Days** : To accurately calculate the loss ratio, a crucial factor was determining the number of days each policy was in effect within a specific financial year. I designed a custom function to extract this information.

**Loss Ratio Calculation** : With the policy elapsed days calculated, I proceeded to determine the premium per day and, consequently, the loss ratio. This metric is vital for assessing the company's financial health and risk management strategies.

**Data Quality Enhancement** : While analyzing the data, I uncovered irregularities and inconsistencies, which were brought to the company's attention. These findings opened a dialogue on improving their data collection system for greater accuracy and reliability.

## Outcomes and Benefits

**Efficient Data Analysis** : The project streamlined the company's data analysis process, providing critical insights into their loss ratio.

**Custom Function Development** : By creating a specialized function to calculate policy elapsed days, I enabled precise loss ratio calculations.

**Enhanced Decision-Making** : Accurate premium per day calculations empowered the company to make informed decisions about pricing and risk management.

**Data Quality Improvement** : The identification of data irregularities led to discussions about enhancing the data collection system, ultimately improving data accuracy.

## Key Tools and Technologies

**Excel** : Utilized for data integration and preliminary analysis.

**Python** : Employed for developing the custom policy elapsed days calculation function.

## Conclusion

This project significantly streamlined the car insurance company's operations by automating loss ratio calculations. Furthermore, the data analysis uncovered areas for data collection system enhancement, potentially saving the company resources in the long run.
